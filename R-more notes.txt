standard deviation question?

mutate(hour = hour(starttime) %>% group_by(ymd, hour) %>% summarize (num_trips = n()) %>% group_by(hour) %>% summarize(mean_trips =mean(num_trips), sd_trips = sd(num_trips))

explanation:

group_by(ymd, hour) %>% summarize(num_trips = n()): table { day  hour   #trips }
							     1    1	   17
							     2    1	   20
							     2    4	   16

group_by(hour): takes previous table and groups it by hour (so first two columns with hour=1 will group)


summarize(mean_trips =mean(num_trips) will add mean_trips to the group by hours


geoms to checkout/use: geom_point, errorbar, pointrange, ribbon

errorbar(ymin = mean - sd, ymax = mean + sd)


ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = hour, y = mean))  facet_wrap (~day_of_week)

ifelse - understands vector comparisons, whereas regular if/else does not 
Vectorize (single_function) #allows function to apply computations to vector rather than single element

group_by(year) - groups BINS by year

ex: 

year gender numtrips
1900 M      5
1900 F      8

1901 M      3

Note that 1900 is one group/bin, but is split into two rows)


%>% spread(gender, numtrips) {key, value}

year M F U
1900 5 8 NA 


trips %>% group_by(start_station_id, end_station_id) %>% summarize(col3 = sum(start_station_id,end_station_id)) 
#creates groups of all combinations of start-end station ids, and accumulates the sum of EACH GROUP in a column
# ex: for startid = 72 and endid= 72 group, sum != 144, but 144 * 576, because there are 576 such trips in this group
# this shows what group_by does..

trips %>% summarize(col3 = sum(start_station_id,end_station_id)) 

trips %>% filter(start_station_id == 72 & end_station_id == 72)
trips %>% group_by(start_station_id, end_station_id) %>% filter(start_station_id == 72 & end_station_id == 72)
