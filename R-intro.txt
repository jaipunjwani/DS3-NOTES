1) Map a discrete variable to color, size, alpha, and shape. Then map a continuous variable to each.
 Does ggplot2 behave differently for discrete vs. continuous variables?

The discrete variables in mpg are: manufacturer, model, trans, drv, fl, class
The continuous variables in mpg are: displ, year, cyl, cty, hwy

Shape - only takes discrete - up to 6
Size - not advised for discrete

YES, ggplot2 differentiates between discrete/continuous in some scenarios


2) Map the same variable to multiple aesthetics in the same plot. Does it work? How many legends does ggplot2 create?
- Works, but not very helpful? Ex: color = model, alpha = model. creates one combined legend, with colors more transparent
 
3) Attempt to set an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like displ < 5. What happens?
Graph is broken down into true/false sections
