3.2 exercises
1) Map a discrete variable to color, size, alpha, and shape. Then map a continuous variable to each.
 Does ggplot2 behave differently for discrete vs. continuous variables?

The discrete variables in mpg are: manufacturer, model, trans, drv, fl, class
The continuous variables in mpg are: displ, year, cyl, cty, hwy

Shape - only takes discrete - up to 6
Size - not advised for discrete

YES, ggplot2 differentiates between discrete/continuous in some scenarios


2) Map the same variable to multiple aesthetics in the same plot. Does it work? How many legends does ggplot2 create?
- Works, but not very helpful? Ex: color = model, alpha = model. creates one combined legend, with colors more transparent
 
3) Attempt to set an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like displ < 5. What happens?
Graph is broken down into true/false sections

3.4.1 exercises
1) What would this graph look like?
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()

graph of display vs. hwy; data points would be differentiated by class (via color); there would be two geom_graphs overlayed on top of each other - one with the individual points, 
one connected with lines and gray areas to show uncertainty

2) Will these two graphs look different?
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()

ggplot(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(data = mpg)

no, they specify the same exact thing


DPLYR:

piping operator: %>%

Verbs:
1) Filter: 
	allows you to subset observations
	input: N rows 
	output: variable number of rows that match given condition 
	Note: {happens per group}


- arrange: order rows sorted by given columns
- mutate: input N rows, output N rows
- select: extract a subset of columns
- summarize: input N rows, output 1 row {per group }
- group_by
- ungroup: remove groupings {BEST PRACTICE: UNGROUP WHEN DONE}
